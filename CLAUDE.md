# TaskbarFolders

Windows-only WPF/.NET 8 desktop app. iOS-style taskbar grouping for Windows 11.

## Commands

```bash
dotnet build TaskbarFolders.sln -c Release
dotnet test  TaskbarFolders.sln -c Release
dotnet format --verify-no-changes      # CI enforces — run before commit
```

**Local test requirement:** Windows only — Linux/macOS cannot run the tests. `Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.x x64` is what the tests target; if the machine only has a newer major (this one has 10.x), run `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor dotnet test …` and everything passes. The same variable is needed to launch the built exes directly, or the host exits with 0x80008096. SDK is pinned in `global.json` (8.0.100, `rollForward=latestMajor`).

## Architecture

Four-project solution. Dependencies flow Manager/Launcher → Core → Shared.

| Project | Purpose | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| `TaskbarFolders.Shared` | Models, JSON persistence, file logging | **No Windows-only APIs** — keep portable |
| `TaskbarFolders.Core` | Icon engine, Win32 P/Invoke, shortcut generation | `[SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]` |
| `TaskbarFolders.Manager` | WPF group-CRUD app | DI via `ManagerServiceCollectionExtensions` |
| `TaskbarFolders.Launcher` | Per-group popup (short-lived per click) | DI via `LauncherServiceCollectionExtensions` |

## Project Conventions

- **Strict MVVM** — no business logic in code-behind. Commands via `[RelayCommand]` (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm 8.3.2).
- **DI everywhere** — register in `*ServiceCollectionExtensions`, inject via constructor. `CompositionRootTests` validates the Manager graph at build.
- **File-scoped namespaces**, `_camelCase` private fields, PascalCase for `const` fields.
- **XML doc comments required** on public members. Enforced: `GenerateDocumentationFile` is on for `src` (off for `tests`), so `CS1591` is actually emitted, and `TreatWarningsAsErrors` makes it fail the build. Until that property was set the rule was documented but inert.
- **Async I/O** — all persistence and shell calls async, except `IIconCache.TryGet/Set` (sync on purpose; UI hot path).

## Non-Obvious Patterns

**Atomic writes** — used in `JsonGroupConfigStore`, `JsonAppSettingsStore`, `IcoFileWriter`, `FileSystemIconCache`:

```csharp
File.WriteAllBytes(target + ".tmp", bytes);
File.Move(target + ".tmp", target, overwrite: true);
```

New persistence code must follow this.

**HICON discipline** — every `SHGetFileInfo` / `IImageList.GetIcon` `HICON` must be released in `finally` via `DestroyIcon`; every COM RCW via `Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject`. Instantiate the RCW **before** `try` so a CLSID-not-registered failure doesn't leave the `finally` with a half-constructed object (see `ShellIconExtractor.ResolvePath`).

**Pin-to-taskbar = Strategy C** — per-group `.lnk` with a distinct AUMID stamped via `IPropertyStore` + `PKEY_AppUserModel_ID`. The `Launcher.exe` is shared; grouping is purely AUMID-driven. **Do not** introduce per-group `.exe` copies + `UpdateResource` (Strategy A) — ruled out in M5 spike because unsigned dynamically-modified PEs trigger Defender false positives.

**GroupId validation** — `AppDataPathProvider` enforces `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,96}$`. Any path-derived storage code (groups, per-group shortcut dirs) must funnel through `GetGroupFile` / `GetGroupDirectory` so the validation isn't bypassed.

**JSON config** — `Id` in `GroupConfig` is always reconstructed from the file name on load (disk layout is the source of truth; JSON `id` field is ignored). See `JsonGroupConfigStore.LoadFromFileAsync`.

**Cross-thread BitmapSource** — `Freeze()` inside the producer lambda *before* `await` crosses back to the UI thread (see `PopupViewModel.LoadIconForAsync`). An unfrozen bitmap that crosses threads carries the wrong dispatcher affinity and the WPF Image binding throws.

**CancellationTokenSource fields → IDisposable** — Adding a CTS field triggers CA1001. Make the owner `sealed … IDisposable` and have `Dispose` call the cancel-and-dispose helper (`PopupViewModel`, `GroupEditorViewModel` follow this).

**Launcher failure paths must reach the file log** — `Trace`-only diagnostics are forbidden in the Launcher. Every early-exit (`Shutdown(n)`) and every catch that ends startup goes through `StartupFailureLogger` (DI-free, never throws, same line format/file as `FileLogger`). The v0.4.x popup regression exited with code 3 on every click for weeks while the log showed nothing — because the failure was `Trace`-only. Exit codes are documented in `App` remarks: 1 = no group id, 3 = startup threw, 4 = unhandled dispatcher exception.

**TaskbarManager takes no HWND** — `InitializeWithWindow.Initialize` applies to WinRT types that own a modal surface (`FileOpenPicker`, `FolderPicker`); `Windows.UI.Shell.TaskbarManager` comes from `GetDefault()` and does not implement `IInitializeWithWindow`. Calling it throws `InvalidCastException` from the CsWinRT marshaller. That one line made everything after it in `TaskbarPinRunner` unreachable from v0.4.0 to v0.4.8 — including the diagnostic meant to explain pin failures. `RequestPinCurrentAppAsync` parents its own dialog; what it needs is for the process to hold the **foreground**, which is a `Window.Activate()` concern, not an interop one. Related: never trust its return value — verify a pin landed by matching AUMIDs in the shell's pinned-items folder, because it has been observed reporting success while persisting nothing.

**A disabled control cannot explain itself** — WPF does not render a `ToolTip` on a disabled element unless `ToolTipService.ShowOnDisabled="True"` is set on it. v0.4.4 disabled `+ Add` until a group name was entered and attached a tooltip saying so; the tooltip was unreachable in exactly the state it described, and a fresh installer could not work out how to create a group at all (fixed in v0.4.6). Any control that is conditionally disabled must either set `ShowOnDisabled` or carry the explanation somewhere always visible. Related: `FocusManager.FocusedElement` on the `Window` is the declarative way to put the caret where input is expected on open — it sidesteps the `Loaded`-fires-inside-`Show()` trap below.

**Window accepts only identity RenderTransforms** — `Window.CoerceRenderTransform` throws `InvalidOperationException` for any non-identity transform, including one declared in XAML (kills `InitializeComponent`). Scale/animate a child element (`ChromeRoot` in `PopupWindow`) instead. Related: a `Window` raises `Loaded` synchronously *inside* `Show()` — subscribe before `Show()` or the handler never runs.

**DPI unit contract (fixed in v0.4.3)** — everything crossing the Win32 boundary (taskbar/monitor rects, `GetCursorPos`, `ICursorAnchor`) is **device pixels**; `TaskbarPositionHelper.CalculatePlacement` converts to WPF DIPs exactly once using the target monitor's effective DPI (`GetDpiForMonitor`). Do not pre-convert values before seeding the anchor and do not feed DIP values into `CalculatePlacement`'s Win32 parameters — a double conversion reintroduces the pre-v0.4.3 placement drift at ≠100% scaling.

## Analyzer Suppressions (rationale)

Project-wide `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild=true` + `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`. Suppressions in `.editorconfig`:

- `CA1716` global — `TaskbarFolders.Shared` namespace clashes with a VB.NET reserved word (irrelevant for Windows-only C# app).
- `CA1848` / `CA1873` global — `LoggerMessage` source generators not used; cold-path logging only. Hot paths can opt in.
- `CA1707` / `CA1859` / `CA1861` `tests/**` only — xUnit naming convention + perf rules don't apply to test code.
- `IDE1006` is **not** suppressed — a separate `required_modifiers=const` naming rule allows `PascalCase` const fields alongside `_camelCase` private fields, so both satisfy the rule rather than one being exempted from it.

If you suppress an analyzer, add the rationale in `.editorconfig` next to the suppression.

## Definition of Done

Nothing is finished until every line below holds. Each one is here because it was violated
in this repository and cost a release, a broken feature, or a false claim — the reasons are
kept so the rule stays arguable rather than ritual.

- **Documentation moves with the code, in the same commit.** See the table below. User-visible
  changes need **both** `docs/user-guide.md` and `docs/benutzerhandbuch.md`.
- **Screenshots are part of the interface.** If the UI changes visibly, retake them. Recipe, so
  they stay comparable: display scaling at 150 %, crop to `DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS` with a
  2 px inset (the shadow region otherwise lets the desktop bleed into the edges), same group
  selected in both themes. Files live in `assets/screenshots/`.
- **Evaluate the format gate, do not announce it.** `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` prints
  errors and still exits 0 in a pipeline — read the output. New `.cs` files need **CRLF and a
  UTF-8 BOM** or the gate fails on `ENDOFLINE`/`CHARSET`.
- **Look at visual changes.** A contrast or layout claim rests on having seen the result:
  screenshot the running window, or render the control offscreen with `RenderTargetBitmap` on an
  STA thread. Dark mode sat at 1.2:1 through several releases because nobody looked.
- **Run interop and WinRT paths, do not just compile them.** The suite is headless and cannot
  reach WinRT. Pin-to-taskbar was broken from v0.4.0 to v0.4.8 behind a bad cast that no test
  could see; `Launcher.exe --pin-mode --group-id <id>` plus the log would have caught it in
  one run.
- **Verify the verifier.** A gate that never fires is not a gate. When adding one, feed it an
  input that must fail and confirm it does.
- **Coverage is gated, not aspired to.** CI fails below 65 % line coverage and at exactly 0 %.
  Release uses `DebugType=embedded`; with `none` coverlet has nothing to instrument and every
  report is silently empty.
- **Release notes come from `CHANGELOG.md`.** `generate_release_notes` produces a bare compare
  link here, because releases are cut from direct pushes.
- **Repo presentation is part of the product.** Description and topics on the repository,
  author in `Directory.Build.props`, `LICENSE` and `installer/setup.iss` — all kept accurate.
- **No inbox address in a committed file.** Security reports go through GitHub's private
  vulnerability reporting, conduct reports through the profile and GitHub's abuse form. The
  repository's `user.email` is the GitHub noreply address, set repo-locally, so commits do
  not leak one either. A published address collects spam, not reports.
- **Known limitations become issues.** A limitation recorded only in prose is invisible; open
  one with the file references and acceptance criteria.
- **Branch protection**: `main` and `develop` reject force-pushes and deletion; `develop`
  requires the `build` check on pull requests. Direct pushes to `develop` stay allowed —
  solo-maintained, no reviewer to wait for.
- **No AI/agent mentions** in any human-facing committed file. Tooling files like this one are
  exempt. Grep the diff before committing.

## Repo Policy

- **Documentation moves with the code.** Every change, implementation or update also brings the documentation it affects up to date, **in the same commit** — not in a follow-up, not "later". A behaviour change whose documentation still describes the old behaviour is not finished. This is not bureaucracy: the guides once sat three minor versions behind and actively misdescribed the pinning flow, which is how a user ends up following instructions for a design the project had abandoned. Which files a change touches:

  | Changed | Also update |
  |---|---|
  | User-visible behaviour, a button, a dialog, a setting | `docs/user-guide.md` **and** `docs/benutzerhandbuch.md` — the pair is only useful if both move together |
  | Component boundaries, data flow, storage layout, startup order | `docs/architecture.md` |
  | Public types or their signatures | `docs/api-reference.md` |
  | Build, test, debug, conventions, analyzer rules | `docs/developer-guide.md` |
  | A new failure mode, exit code, or known limitation | `docs/troubleshooting.md` |
  | Anything about versioning, tagging or the pipeline | `docs/release-process.md` |
  | A decision that constrains future work | a new ADR under `docs/adr/`, added to its index |
  | A new convention or invariant | this file |
  | Anything at all | a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `[Unreleased]` |

- **No AI/agent mentions** in code, comments, commits, docs, or any human-facing committed file. Tooling files like this one are exempt.
- **Conventional Commits** — `<type>(<scope>): <desc>`. Types per `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Branching** — `develop` is integration, `main` is releases, feature branches off `develop`.

## Where things live at runtime

- Group configs: `%APPDATA%/TaskbarFolders/groups/<id>.json`
- Per-group composite icon: `%APPDATA%/TaskbarFolders/icons/<id>.ico`
- Per-group shortcut (Strategy C `.lnk`): `%APPDATA%/TaskbarFolders/shortcuts/<id>.lnk`
- Settings: `%APPDATA%/TaskbarFolders/settings.json`
- Icon cache: `%APPDATA%/TaskbarFolders/icons/cache/<sha256>.png`
- Logs: `%APPDATA%/TaskbarFolders/logs/{manager,launcher}-yyyy-MM-dd.log`

## Installed layout (read before touching `LauncherPathResolver`)

The Inno Setup installer and the portable ZIP both ship Manager and Launcher in **sibling folders**, not one directory:

```
{app}\Manager\TaskbarFolders.Manager.exe
{app}\Launcher\TaskbarFolders.Launcher.exe
```

`LauncherPathResolver` probes three layouts (`side-by-side` → `sibling folder` → `dev sln walk-up`). Any new packaging must match one of those, or the resolver gains a fourth probe. The v0.2.0 release shipped without the sibling probe and the `Show shortcut...` button was silently broken for every install — regression test in `LauncherPathResolverTests.TryResolveFrom_FindsLauncherInSiblingFolder_MatchingInstallerLayout` guards against repeating it.

## Workflow for non-trivial work

This project is solo-maintained; senior-dev workflow expectations apply.

**1. Analyse before changing anything.** Read the files end-to-end (XAML binding → VM command → service → P/Invoke), check the runtime log under `%APPDATA%/TaskbarFolders/logs/`, and form a falsifiable root-cause hypothesis. Quote line numbers when you state the cause.

**2. Orchestrate subagents when the task warrants it.** Rule of thumb: trivial edits go direct; multi-file fixes get a `Plan` agent first; bug investigations across more than two files get an `Explore` agent in parallel; anything user-blocking gets a `general-purpose` agent for independent code review **before push**. Brief each agent self-contained (file paths, line numbers, constraints from this CLAUDE.md) — they cannot see the conversation.

**3. Bug-fixing waves.** Group changes into reviewable commits: one commit per behavioural concern (e.g. resolver fix, UX fix, UX defence-in-depth), each with its own tests. Run `dotnet build -c Release` after every wave, and `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor dotnet test -c Release` — tests do run locally, see above. Address code-review findings as a polish commit on top — never amend a pushed commit, never amend across reviewable boundaries.

**4. Complete testing — including the runtime layout that ships.** Build + unit tests in CI is necessary but not sufficient. The v0.2.0 "Show shortcut" bug existed *only* in the installed and portable layouts; the dev `dotnet run` and the CI test runner both used a layout where the launcher happened to be findable. Every release-eligible change must be verified in all three runtimes it touches:

  - **Unit tests** — `dotnet test -c Release` (CI) — must be green before push, no exceptions. Pushing red and "fixing forward" is forbidden because it muddies bisects.
  - **Format gate** — `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` (CI) — fix locally before push.
  - **Dev run** — `dotnet run --project src/TaskbarFolders.Manager` — for any change that touches MVVM, DI, XAML, or services. Click the affected button.
  - **Installer/portable smoke** — after tagging, before announcing: actually install `TaskbarFolders-Setup.exe` (or unzip the portable) and walk the user-visible happy path end-to-end (create group → drop apps → click the affected feature). Two minutes of clicking catches what 200 unit tests do not. **This step would have caught the v0.2.0 bug before users did.**
  - **Log inspection** — open `%APPDATA%/TaskbarFolders/logs/manager-*.log` after the smoke test. A warning or error line with no user-visible counterpart is a UX bug.

  If you cannot run the installer smoke (e.g. no Windows machine to hand), say so explicitly in the PR/commit message rather than imply the feature is verified. Future-you reading the log will know what was actually tested.

**5. Commits.** Conventional Commits (`fix(manager): …`, `feat(core): …`). Body explains the *why* and the *blast radius*, not the *what* — assume the reader has the diff. No AI/agent mentions, and no `Co-Authored-By` trailer naming a tool — human co-authors are fine and should be credited. Run `dotnet format` **before staging each commit** — *not* between commits. v0.2.1 CI failed because format auto-fixed BOMs on files that were committed in Wave 1, but the fix landed in the working tree only and was never staged. Format → `git status` → stage everything modified → commit.

**6. Pushing & releasing.** Bug fixes land on `develop` directly (no PR — solo-maintained). Patch releases tag `v0.x.y` from `develop`; `release.yml` publishes the assets. Bump `Directory.Build.props:Version`, `installer/setup.iss:MyAppVersion`, `src/TaskbarFolders.Manager/app.manifest:assemblyIdentity/@version` (four-part, e.g. `0.4.5.0`), the README status banner, and add a `CHANGELOG.md` section in the same commit as the tag-eligible state. Full checklist in `docs/release-process.md`. If a fix is user-blocking on a shipped version, cut a patch release the same day. **Wait for the installer-smoke pass before announcing the release as available** — the tag and the assets exist before they're verified.

**7. Documentation upkeep.** Before calling any change done, walk the table in Repo Policy and update every row the change touched, in the same commit. When a fix introduces a new convention or invariant, surface it here too — the next session reads this file before doing anything else.

## Release

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `release.yml`: builds, publishes self-contained, builds the Inno Setup installer (ISCC is pre-installed on `windows-latest`), uploads `TaskbarFolders-portable.zip` + `TaskbarFolders-Setup.exe`. The release job needs `permissions: contents: write` (already set).

**Asset size baseline (v0.4.10, measured from the published release):** portable ZIP ≈ 167 MB (166,691,561 B), Setup.exe ≈ 112 MB (112,208,154 B) — about +145 KB each versus v0.4.9, which is the cost of `DebugType=embedded`. A collapse to a fraction of this means a publish step produced a framework-dependent build. `PublishReadyToRun=true` (Launcher + Manager) roughly doubled the size vs v0.2.1 because the entire .NET runtime is AOT-compiled into the publish. Plan estimates that assume "~10 MB R2R cost" are wildly low — count on +50-70 MB per binary.
